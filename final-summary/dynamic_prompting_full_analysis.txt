RQ4: Incorrect Vulnerability Generation Patterns

Top Unexpected Vulnerability Mappings (Expected → Violated):

                write                    dereference failure: null pointer     16
                 read                    dereference failure: null pointer     15
       use after free                    dereference failure: null pointer      7
       use after free      dereference failure: invalidated dynamic object      5
      invalid pointer                             buffer overflow on scanf      3
     integer overflow                             buffer overflow on scanf      2
                 read                             buffer overflow on scanf      1
                 read dereference failure: write access to string constant      1
     forgotten memory                             buffer overflow on scanf      1
     forgotten memory                            buffer overflow on fscanf      1
         null pointer                             buffer overflow on scanf      1
array bounds violated        operand of free must have zero pointer offset      1
      invalid pointer                            buffer overflow on fscanf      1
     integer overflow                    dereference failure: null pointer      1
